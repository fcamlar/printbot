# EV3 Print Bot

This is the code for my EV3 Print Bot project, which can receive and process audio commands from an Alexa powered Echo device.

There are two components to the code. The node.js Alexa Skill code, which manages the Alexa side of things, and the ev3dev code which runs on the EV3 brick and manages the EV3 side of things.
